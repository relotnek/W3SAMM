# Web3 Assessment and Governance Maturity Model for Security (WAGMMS)

**Boundaries and Purpose**
This maturity model is intended to be used to measure projects and organizations operating in the web3 or decentralized web space. It is intended to be used as a self-assessment for organizations as well as an authoritative baseline to externally measure organizations or projects. There is no regulatory body determining interpretation of each of the core functions, but it may be expanded on and firmed up by an organization to be used as an authoritative measure.

**Application and Use**

The model is broken up into Core Functions, which are divided into Functional Areas. Each Functional Area is broken into two streams which have unique control criteria. The Control Criteria must be met in order for the Functional Area to be measured above 0.
